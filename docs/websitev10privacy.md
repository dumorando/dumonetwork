**Effective Date:** August 30, 2025  

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you visit **Dumorando.com**, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.

## 1. Information We Collect
When you visit Dumorando.com, the following information is collected automatically:  

- **IP Address (Hashed):** Your IP address is collected and immediately converted into a hashed (anonymized) value.  
- **Visitor Count Data:** The hashed IP is stored in a database to help maintain a unique visitor counter.  

No other personal information (such as your name, email, or browsing activity) is collected.

---

## 2. How We Use the Information
The hashed IP addresses are used **only** to:  
- Count unique visitors to the Website.  
- Prevent duplicate counting of the same visitor.  

We do **not** use this data for advertising, profiling, or tracking your activity across other websites.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Retention
- Hashed IP addresses are stored securely in a database.  
- Data is retained only as long as necessary to maintain accurate visitor statistics.  
- Since the IPs are hashed, they cannot be directly linked back to you.

---

## 4. Cookies and Tracking
- Dumorando.com does **not** use cookies.  
- Dumorando.com does **not** use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking technologies.

## 5. Sharing of Information
We do **not** sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.  
The data is used exclusively for the Websiteâ€™s visitor counter.

## 6. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have certain privacy rights (such as under the **GDPR** in the EU or **CCPA** in California). These may include:  
- The right to know what data is collected.  
- The right to request deletion of your data.  
- The right to object to data collection.  

Currently, Dumorando.com does not provide an automated way to exercise these rights through the website. If you wish to make a privacy-related request, please contact the Website owner directly. Requests will be honored to the extent technically possible, given that only hashed IP addresses are stored.

## 7. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect stored data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
